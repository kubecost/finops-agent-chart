# Helm Chart for the IBM FinOps Agent&trade; Core

TODO

## TL;DR

```console
helm install my-release oci://TODO
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps an IBM FinOps Agent deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.31+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/finops-agent
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository.

These commands deploy the FinOps Agent on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Configuration and installation details

### FinOps Agent pod Service

This chart installs a deployment with the following configuration:

```text
                 ----------------
                |  FinOps Agent  |
                |      svc       |
                 ----------------
                        |
                        \/
                  --------------
                 | FinOps Agent |
                 |     Pod      |
                  --------------
```

The service is used primarily to provide diagnostics information and a scrape target. The FinOps Agent itself does not provide data querying, that is supported by the suite of IBM products that utilize the agent data. 

### Configure the Export Bucket

The IBM FinOps Agent can collect and store limited data on its local storage. To be viewed and used for FinOps activities, however, the data must be uploaded to an object store so that it can be consumed by products in the IBM FinOps suite like Cloudability and Kubecost. 

The bucket secret syntax itself is specified further in TODO - INSERT LINK 

To provide a secret, see the `exportBucket` settings in the parameters section. The chart allows the user to provide an already installed secret via the `existingSecret` parameter. Alternatively, the `create` setting can be set to true, which will allow the chart to create a secret using the contents of the `config` setting. 

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcesPreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### Prometheus metrics

This chart can be integrated with Prometheus by setting `metrics.enabled` to `true`. This will add the required annotations on the FinOps Agent service to be automatically scraped by Prometheus.

#### Prometheus requirements

It is necessary to have a working installation of Prometheus or Prometheus Operator for the integration to work. Install the [Bitnami Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/prometheus) or the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) to easily have a working Prometheus in your cluster.

#### Integration with Prometheus Operator

The chart can deploy `ServiceMonitor` objects for integration with Prometheus Operator installations. To do so, set the value `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true`. Ensure that the Prometheus Operator `CustomResourceDefinitions` are installed in the cluster or it will fail with the following error:

```text
no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
```

### Adding extra environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables, you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: MY_EXTRA_ENV_VAR
    value: "true"
```

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter(s). Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.


## Persistence

Local data can be persisted by default using PVC(s), to survive restarts until uploaded to bucket storage. You can disable the persistence setting the `persistence.enabled` parameter to `false`.

A default `StorageClass` is needed in the Kubernetes cluster to dynamically provision the volumes. Specify another StorageClass in the `persistence.storageClass` or set `persistence.existingClaim` if you have already existing persistent volumes to use.

      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
